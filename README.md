## Cyfrin Updraft - NFT Smart Contract
This repo is from Cyfrin Updraft's Foundry Fundamentals course which walks through creating an ERC-721/NFT Smart Contract. This part of the course goes over using IPFS or SVGs to host NFTs, `abi.encodePacked` and `keccak256()` for encoding and hashing, modifying NFTs on chain, and some evm low-level calls/opcodes etc;.
